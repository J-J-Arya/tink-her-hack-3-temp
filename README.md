### Project Description
[RoomRevamp is a platform that helps hostel students buy, share, and resell items easily. It allows users to share common items with roommates to avoid conflicts, resell items they no longer need, and find affordable second-hand products. By maximizing resources and reducing waste, RoomRevamp makes hostel living more efficient, sustainable, and cost-effective.]

----!!THE PROJECT STARTS FROM splash.html----

### The Problem statement
[RoomRevamp is solving the ridiculous problem of ownership disputes and wasteful purchases in hostel living. 

Students often end up buying items like kettles, furniture, or appliances for shared use, but the problem arises when it comes time to decide who gets to keep them or who has to take them home. This leads to unnecessary conflicts and the waste of perfectly good items. 

Additionally, students often buy low-quality items just to avoid transporting them home, resulting in money wasted on things that won‚Äôt last or aren‚Äôt fully utilized.]

### The Solution
[RoomRevamp eliminates these issues by:

.Allowing students to share and resell items, reducing conflicts over ownership.
.Ensuring items are maximized for utility and resold to others when no longer needed, preventing waste and saving money.
.Enabling students to buy quality items from the market and resell them later,  ensuring they get the best value and can even purchase high-rated products without worrying about long-term ownership.
